    <h2>Elijah Foard's User Manual</h2>
    <h1>My Style</h1>
    <p>
        I am introverted and quiet in large group settings but talkative in one-on-one situations. I usually won’t step into situations unless I am directly asked. I can actually talk quite a bit about random topics that I have a large knowledge of for no particular reason.
    </p>

    <h1>My Values</h1>
    <p>
        I value getting my work done as soon as possible and as best as I can. I typically sit down and get my work done in one sitting so I can have that feeling of accomplishment.

    </p>

    <h1> When to approach me</h1>
    <p>
        The best time to approach me would be while I am not busy and while I’m with somebody I know
    </p>

    <h1>How to best communicate with me</h1>
    <p>
        Usually directly talking to me is less stressful than phone calls or texts because I can’t read tone over texts
    </p>

    <h1>How I make decisions</h1>
    <p>
        I think about the outcomes from each decision and determine which will be the best for the situation
    </p>

    <h1>What people misunderstand about me</h1>
    <p>
        I am not in a constant state of anger :)
    </p>
    
    <h1>How to help me</h1>
    <p>
        If I seem to be struggling with something I usually ask others for help but you can ask me directly and I will tell you if I need help or not
